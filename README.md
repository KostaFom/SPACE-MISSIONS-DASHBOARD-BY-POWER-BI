# Netzwerk Dashboard Analysis #
## Zielsetzung ##
### --The objective of this project is to analyze space missions data to identify trends and patterns over time. Specifically, we aim to address the following questions:-- ###

### 1.How have rocket launches trended across time? Has the mission success rate increased? ###
### 2. Which countries have had the most successful space missions? Has it always been that way? ###
### 3. Which rocket has been used for the most space missions? Is it still active? ###
### 4. Are there any patterns noticeable with the launch locations? ###
## Conclusion: ##
### After conducting analysis using various visualizations, including area charts, scatter plots, column bar charts, and donut charts, we have reached the following conclusions: ###

### Rocket Launch Trends: The area chart representing missions over the years indicates a steady increase in rocket launches over time. Moreover, the mission success rate appears to have improved gradually. ###

### Successful Space Missions by Countries: Our analysis reveals that certain countries have consistently achieved higher success rates in space missions compared to others. The column bar chart depicting successful missions by country provides insights into these trends. ###

### Most Used Rocket: By examining the column chart for missions by rockets, we identified the rocket that has been used for the most space missions. Additionally, we evaluated its current activity status to understand its ongoing relevance. ###

### Launch Location Patterns: Through the scattered plot illustrating missions by location, we observed patterns in launch locations and potential correlations with mission success rates. Further analysis could reveal underlying factors influencing these patterns. ###

## This analysis provides valuable insights into the history and trends of space missions, aiding in understanding the evolution of space exploration efforts globally. ##

## Visualizations Used: ##
### - Area Chart: Mission Over Years ###
### - Scatter Plot: Missions by Location ###
### - Column Bar Chart: Successful Missions by Category ###
### - Column Chart: Missions by Rockets ### 
### - Donut Chart: Missions by Status (Success/Failure) ### 
### - The visualizations included in the dashboard offer a comprehensive overview of space mission trends and patterns, facilitating data-driven decision-making and further exploration of space exploration endeavors. ###
